      "solution": "Since the surface area of the original cube is 24 square meters, each face of the cube has a surface area of $24/6 = 4$ square meters, and the side length of this cube is 2  meters. The sphere inscribed within the cube has diameter 2 meters,  which is also the length of the diagonal of the cube inscribed in the sphere. Let $l$ represent the side length of the inscribed cube. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice gives \\[\nl^2 + l^2 + l^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n\\]Hence each face has surface area \\[\nl^2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\ \\text{square meters}.\n\\]So the surface area of the inscribed cube is $6\\cdot (4/3) = \\boxed{8}$ square meters.",

          "solution": "Since the surface area of the original cube is 24 square meters, each face of the cube has a surface area of 24 divided by 6 equals 4 square meters, and the side length of this cube is 2 meters. The sphere inscribed within the cube has diameter 2 meters, which is also the length of the diagonal of the cube inscribed in the sphere. Let l represent the side length of the inscribed cube. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice gives l squared plus l squared plus l squared equals 2 squared equals 4. Hence each face has surface area l squared equals 4 over 3 square meters.

We have the equation  \\[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \\Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\\]Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\\pm \\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a negative sign in front of the square root.

Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=-\\sqrt{625}+24=-1$.

          "solution": "Moving all the terms to the left-hand side, we have the equation x squared minus 14x plus y squared minus 48y equals 0. Completing the square on the quadratic in x, we add 14 over 2 squared, which is 49, to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in y, we add 48 over 2 squared, which is 576, to both sides. We have the equation (x squared minus 14x plus 49) plus (y squared minus 48y plus 576) equals 625, which simplifies to (x minus 7) squared plus (y minus 24) squared equals 625. Rearranging, we have (y minus 24) squared equals 625 minus (x minus 7) squared. Taking the square root and solving for y, we get y equals plus or minus the square root of 625 minus (x minus 7) squared plus 24.

Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize 625 minus (x minus 7) squared. Since (x minus 7) squared is always nonnegative, 625 minus (x minus 7) squared is maximized when (x minus 7) squared equals 0 or when x equals 7. At this point, 625 minus (x minus 7) squared equals 625 and y equals negative square root of 625 plus 24, which is negative 1.

Therefore, if lcm of nu and 20 equals 60, then nu must be divisible by 3 and we may write nu equals 3 times n (where n is a positive integer).\n\nThus we have lcm of 3 times n and 20 equals 60, and since the 3 times n contributes the factor of 3 to lcm of 3 times n and 20, it follows that lcm of n and 20 equals 60 divided by 3 equals 20. This is true if and only if n is a divisor of 20. Therefore, the possible values of nu are 3 times the positive divisors of 20: nu equals 3, 6, 12, 15, 30, or 60. The sum of these values is 126."
