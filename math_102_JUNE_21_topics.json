By the distance formula, since $(x,y)$ is 13 units from $(7,13)$, we have $$\\sqrt{(x-7)^2+(y-13)^2}=13.$$Since $y$ is either 5 more or 5 less than 13, we know that $(y-13)^2=25$.

Since y is either 5 more or 5 less than 13, we know that (y minus 13) squared equals 25. So we substitute: the square root of (x minus 7) squared plus 25 equals 13. This implies (x minus 7) squared plus 25 equals 13 squared. Simplifying, (x minus 7) squared equals 144. Taking the square root of both sides, x minus 7 equals positive or negative 12. So we have x minus 7 equals 12 or x minus 7 equals negative 12, giving x equals 19 or x equals negative 5.
